# FirstNeuralNetwork

Step by Step code to build first 2 layer neural network

Step 1:
        Import the Dataset, here the dataset was available in the Keras package itself 
Step 2:
        Normalizing the data (Data Pre-Processing)
Step 3: 
        Flattening the data for the input layer, it can be done within the model using the flattening layer or the other way is to use reshape()
Step 4:
        Building your model (network)
Step 5: 
        Fitting the model to the training data
Step 6: 
        Evaluating the model against the test data
Step 7:
        Verifying the model by getting the prediction on a particular set of data
